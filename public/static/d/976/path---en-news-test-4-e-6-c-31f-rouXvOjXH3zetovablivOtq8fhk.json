Staged in the historical public restroom at No. 10 Wusheng Road (built in 1957), the project is a gorgeous retrofit of the pre-existing facilities; including an Accessible Room on the first floor and a Nursing Room on the second floor.</p>\n<p>The design of these facilities carefully fuses WeCare WC’s classic, sleek and intuitive aesthetics with elements of traditional Chinese culture and modern, cosmopolitan Shanghai.
