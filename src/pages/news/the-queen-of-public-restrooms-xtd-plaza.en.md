With the inspirational effects of Women’s Day still pulsing around the globe, WeCare WC is here to follow it up by inaugurating its “Queen of Public Restrooms” at the brand new Xintiandi Plaza.
<br>
<br>
Introducing WeCare WC’s first Premium Ladies Room; a true symbol of women empowerment, inspired by all of the mothers, daughters, grandmothers, CEOs, doctors, leaders, and other women that are pivotal in making the world a better place.

The room, divided into a restroom area and social lounge, embodies all of the features to make any lady’s day exceptional.
<br>
<br>
On the restroom side, each woman is treated like royalty as she enters a floor to ceiling stall featuring wall-hung Geberit toilets and plenty of positive and encouraging quotes.

Visitors can then wash up in style over a sleek Dupont Corian washing basin with water taps mastered by Danish brand Vola and premium Chinese brand ELLAI.

After freshening up, the one-of-a-kind experience extends to the social lounge, where visitors can tend to other needs or just get some much-deserved relaxation time in. Mothers have the option of entering the nursing room and taking care of their baby in utmost comfort.
